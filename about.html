            <p>
                Hi, I'm Koketso, a 22-year-old aspiring web developer with a passion for technology and creativity. I’m
                currently focused on building a solid foundation in HTML, with plans to expand my skills to become a
                Full Stack Developer.<br />
            </p>

            <p>
                This website serves as both my portfolio and a place to track my learning journey. Beyond coding, I’m
                also excited about helping others bring their ideas to life, whether it’s a personal website, a new app
                concept, or an e-commerce platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring the latest tech trends or enjoying some downtime
                with family and friends. Thanks for stopping by—I’m thrilled to share this journey with you, and I look
                forward to collaborating on exciting projects!
            </p>
